What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A .git folder will be created by git init and all repository-related files will
 be in that folder.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
 What value do you think it offers?
 It's something in between of working directory and repository. It provides something
 flexibility as to what files in the working directory you want to commit.
